Stratus Kernel release 0.x

These are the release notes for Stratus Version 0.

WHAT IS STRATUS?

Stratus is a computing kernel written by Nathan Thomsen for open distrobution.
It aims for breaking free from some of the tainted and aging philosophys of *nix 
and and escaping POSIX compliance. Derived from this abondoning of dying standards
is the adoption of a modernized platform that includes an expected feature set.
To accompany these demanded computation technologies is a new, more advanced
kernel architechture, virtual memory manager, init system, filesystem, and network
stack.

Stratus is proudly distributed under the GNU General Public License. See LICENSE and

ON WHAT HARDWARE DOES IT RUN?

Stratus is developed and optimized for use on amd-x86_64 and i386 based computation
devices. Stratus has planned development for the ARM, IBM s/390, PowerPC, PowerPC64,
and Cell architechtures.

Development for userspace Stratus is also a future goal.
